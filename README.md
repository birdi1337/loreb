# Artist Portfolio Website (URL-Based Images Version)

A colorful and artistic portfolio website for showcasing and selling hand-painted clothing and original artwork. This version uses **image URLs** instead of file uploads.

## ⚠️ Key Differences from Original Version

### What Changed:
1. **✅ No File Uploads** - Admin pastes image URLs instead of uploading files
2. **✅ No Admin Link in Navigation** - Admin panel is hidden, accessible only via direct URL
3. **✅ Simpler Backend** - No file storage, no multer dependency
4. **✅ Cloud-Ready** - Works perfectly with free hosting (Render, Vercel, etc.)

### Benefits:
- 💰 **Free Hosting Compatible** - No need for persistent file storage
- 🚀 **Faster Deployment** - No uploads folder to manage
- 🌍 **Use Any Image Host** - Imgur, Cloudinary, Google Drive, etc.
- 📦 **Smaller Backend** - Simplified code, fewer dependencies

## How to Use Images

### Step 1: Upload Images to Cloud

Upload your images to any free image hosting service:

**Recommended Services:**
- **Imgur** - https://imgur.com (easiest, anonymous upload)
- **Cloudinary** - https://cloudinary.com (free tier: 25GB)
- **ImgBB** - https://imgbb.com (free, no account needed)
- **Google Drive** - Make public and get shareable link

### Step 2: Get Public URL

Make sure the URL:
- ✅ Ends with `.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp`, or `.gif`
- ✅ Is publicly accessible (no login required)
- ✅ Links directly to the image file

**Example:**
```
✅ Good: https://i.imgur.com/abc123.jpg
❌ Bad: https://imgur.com/gallery/abc123 (gallery link)
```

### Step 3: Add to Admin Panel

1. Go to `https://yourdomain.com/admin/login`
2. Login with credentials
3. Click "Add New Item"
4. Paste image URLs in the form

## Managing Items (Production Workflow)

Since admin is disabled in production:

2. **Items save to** `backend/data/items.json`
3. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add backend/data/items.json
   git commit -m "Update items"
   git push
   ```
4. **Render auto-deploys** your changes!

See `ADMIN_ACCESS.md` for detailed instructions.
